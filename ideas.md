# Personal Website Design Brainstorm

## Design Approach 1: Minimalist Academic
**Design Movement:** Swiss Style / Academic Modernism

**Core Principles:**
- Clean typography hierarchy with generous whitespace
- Function-first, no decorative elements
- Grid-based structure with clear visual rhythm
- Emphasis on content over aesthetics

**Color Philosophy:**
- Neutral palette: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a), off-white (#f8f8f8), with a single accent color (teal #0d9488)
- Reasoning: Creates a scholarly, professional atmosphere while the accent draws attention to important sections

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Vertical scrolling with clear section breaks
- Left-aligned text with ample margins
- Asymmetric grid: main content on left, sidebar for navigation/social links on right

**Signature Elements:**
- Thin horizontal dividers between sections
- Monospace font for code/project snippets
- Subtle hover effects (color shift, underline)

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Minimal animations—only on hover
- Focus on readability and accessibility

**Animation:**
- Fade-in on scroll for section content
- Subtle underline animation on links (width expansion)
- No page transitions—instant navigation

**Typography System:**
- Display: IBM Plex Serif Bold (headings)
- Body: IBM Plex Sans Regular (content)
- Code: IBM Plex Mono (technical content)
- Hierarchy: 3.5rem (h1), 2rem (h2), 1.25rem (h3)

- Click feedback with ripple effects
- Smooth transitions between sections

**Animation:**

- Parallax effects on hero section
- Animated gradient backgrounds
- Staggered animations for list items

**Typography System:**

- Focus states with gentle outlines
- Delightful micro-interactions

- Fade-in animations on scroll
- Smooth color transitions on hover
- Gentle scale effects on interactive elements
